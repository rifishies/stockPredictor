Project Overview
This project involves creating a neural network to predict stock prices using simulated data. By modeling stock behavior with sine waves to introduce patterns and noise, the neural network learns to recognize trends and make predictions. The project explores AI applications in finance and demonstrates key concepts in machine learning.

Features
Simulated Stock Data: Sine wave models simulate stock price patterns with noise to mimic real-world fluctuations.
Neural Network Architecture: A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with:
Input layer for stock features.
Hidden layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.
Output layer for price prediction.
Noise Handling: Implements regularization techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.
Optimization: Uses Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss for training.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or later
Libraries:
TensorFlow or PyTorch (for neural network implementation)
NumPy (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
